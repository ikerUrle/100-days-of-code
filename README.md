# I joined #100DaysOfCode !!
You can check out the rules of this challenge [here](rules.md)

## My progress :notebook:
### Day 1: August 16, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I created my GitHub profile README. Used Adobe Illustrator and learnt a bit of Markdown language. 

**Thoughts**: I want to use this challenge to focus on "small" languages like Markdown or learn how to use Software like Photoshop or Illustrator properly, instead of getting better in a single Programming Language.
