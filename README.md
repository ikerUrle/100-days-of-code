# I joined #100DaysOfCode !!
You can check out the rules of this challenge [here](rules.md)

## My progress :notebook:
### Day 1: August 16, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I created my GitHub profile README. Used Adobe Illustrator and learnt a bit of Markdown language. 

**Thoughts**: I want to use this challenge to focus on "small" languages like Markdown or learn how to use Software like Photoshop or Illustrator properly, instead of getting better in a single Programming Language.

### Day 2: August 17, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: I created a simple Coin Toss webpage using HTML5 (without any framework). The goal is to learn proper CSS Styling without using frameworks. 

**Thoughts**: Simple CSS is more painful than I thought on the first place, but I want to learn it to avoid using Frameworks for simple tasks.
