# I joined #100DaysOfCode !!
You can check out the rules of this challenge [here](rules.md)

## My progress :notebook:
### Day 1: August 16, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I created my GitHub profile README. Used Adobe Illustrator and learnt a bit of Markdown language. 

**Thoughts**: I want to use this challenge to focus on "small" languages like Markdown or learn how to use Software like Photoshop or Illustrator properly, instead of getting better in a single Programming Language.

### Day 2: August 17, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: I created a simple Coin Toss webpage using HTML5 (without any framework). The goal is to learn proper CSS Styling without using frameworks. 

**Thoughts**: Simple CSS is more painful than I thought on the first place, but I want to learn it to avoid using Frameworks for simple tasks.

### Day 3: August 18, Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Created a #100DaysOfCode banner to include on all of the new projects. I learnt basic CSS animations and positioning.

**Thoughts**: Simple CSS animations are easy to make but I'm not used to CSS positioning yet.

### Day 4: August 19, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Forked [no-ip-renew](https://github.com/loblab/noip-renew) repo to make the script compatible with Arch Linux.

**Thoughts**: It's the first time I try to contribute to a FOSS project. It feels good!!

### Day 5: August 20, Thursday

### Day 6: August 21, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Built a button that shows the previously created Social Media banner as a Modal.

**Thoughts**: I want to start building a more complex website to include all the designs I have been creating, but I may create some more simple designs first.

### Day 7: August 22, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started learning SASS!! I took all of the code I created on Codepen and started building my personal website (using SASS). Front page of the website is pretty much finished.

**Thoughts**: I love SASS! It feels like using pure CSS but it is super clean.

### Day 8: August 23, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Small progress on my website. I created an "about me" card, but I'm still thinking about the general design of the site. 

**Thoughts**: I'm really picky with the decisions I make around the design. Tomorrow I may change everything all over again. I'm a mess.
